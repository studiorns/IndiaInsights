                    <li>The 19.0% YoY growth in the Moderate scenario indicates strong continued interest in Abu Dhabi from the India market.</li>
                    <li>September stands out as the clear peak month for travel queries, with an index value (367.74) that is more than double the monthly average (182.50).</li>
                    <li>The second highest period is October-December, forming an extended high season for travel interest.</li>
                    <li>June shows the lowest travel query activity (85.28), likely due to summer heat concerns and pre-monsoon conditions in India.</li>
                    <li>The significant difference between peak and low months (367.74 vs 85.28) indicates a highly seasonal market that requires strategic timing of marketing investments.</li>
                    <li>Marketing campaigns should be timed to capitalize on the September peak, considering the 44-day booking window (campaigns should run in July-August).</li>

                    <li>The 2.4 value indicates that the market has extreme seasonal fluctuations, with peak months having about 140% higher travel query activity than the average month.</li>
                    <li>This is significant enough to warrant very strong seasonal marketing strategies.</li>
                    <li>Marketing efforts should be heavily concentrated before peak periods (considering the 44-day booking window).</li>
                    <li>There's also significant opportunity to grow travel interest during off-peak months through targeted campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Resource allocation should follow this seasonal pattern, with increased investment before peak periods.</li>
                    <li>The extreme seasonality suggests a need for differential pricing and promotion strategies across the year.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The 0.48 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 4.8%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with good efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive and moderately strong (approaching 0.5).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI with moderate-to-good efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce significant growth.</li>
                    <li>The moderate-high elasticity suggests that the India market is quite responsive to media campaigns.</li>
                    <li>This responsiveness suggests that media investments should be a priority in this market, particularly during key booking windows.</li>
